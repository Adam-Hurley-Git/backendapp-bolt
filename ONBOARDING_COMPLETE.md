# ✅ Onboarding System - Complete & Ready

## What's Been Implemented

A complete onboarding flow for your CalendarExtension Chrome Extension with **no trial management** - you handle subscriptions your way.

## 🎯 What You Got

### 5 New Pages
1. **`/onboarding`** - Welcome screen with benefits
2. **`/onboarding/personalize`** - User selects their pain point
3. **`/onboarding/demo`** - Interactive feature demos
4. **`/onboarding/complete`** - Success celebration
5. **`/paywall`** - Premium upgrade page

### 3 API Endpoints
- **POST `/api/onboarding/progress`** - Saves user progress
- **POST `/api/onboarding/complete`** - Marks onboarding done
- **GET `/api/user/stats`** - Returns usage statistics

### Database (3 Tables + 2 Columns)
- `onboarding_progress` - Tracks completion
- `feature_usage` - Analytics data
- `paywall_interactions` - Conversion tracking
- Added to `profiles`: `onboarding_completed`, `pain_point`

## 🚀 Setup (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Run Migration

Open Supabase SQL Editor → Paste contents from:
```
supabase/migrations/add_onboarding_tables.sql
```

# Visit: http://localhost:3000/onboarding
```

## 🛡️ No Breaking Changes

**Your existing system is untouched:**
- No modifications to existing tables (only additions)
- No changes to authentication
- No changes to subscription logic
- No changes to payment processing
- Safe to add to existing project

## 📝 Next Steps

1. ✅ Run database migration
2. ⬜ Test onboarding flow
3. ⬜ Customize copy/branding
4. ⬜ Connect to your subscription system
5. ⬜ Add feature tracking from Chrome extension
6. ⬜ Redirect users to `/onboarding` after signup

## 🎯 When to Show What

### Show `/onboarding` when:
- User signs up for first time
- Check `onboarding_completed = false`

### Show `/paywall` when:
- User tries premium feature
- You decide based on your subscription logic
- Manual navigation by user

## 📈 Tracking

Track feature usage from your Chrome extension:

```javascript
await fetch('/api/tracking/feature', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    feature: 'dayColoring',
    action: 'applied'
  })
})
```

This data shows up in stats and can be displayed anywhere.

## 💡 Tips

1. **Redirect after signup**: Add to your signup success handler:
   ```javascript
   if (!user.onboarding_completed) {
     router.push('/onboarding')
   }
   ```

2. **Check before dashboard**: In dashboard, check:
   ```javascript
   if (!profile.onboarding_completed) {
     router.push('/onboarding')
   }
   ```

3. **Show paywall strategically**: You control when/how paywall appears

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Database tables not created?**
- Verify migration ran in Supabase SQL editor
- Check for error messages

**Pages not loading?**
- Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
- Check browser console for errors

**API endpoints failing?**
- Verify user is logged in
- Check network tab for error details
