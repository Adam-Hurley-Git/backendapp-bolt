# Data Persistence Fix - Summary

## Problem
Onboarding and consent data were not being saved to the database, even though the frontend appeared to work correctly.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. API Error Handling
- API routes weren't checking for database errors
- Failed operations returned success responses
- No error logging or reporting

### 2. Database Client Issues
- Wrong Supabase client used in consent API
- `supabaseAdmin` not exposed properly for API routes
- Missing `.select()` after inserts to verify success

### 3. Frontend Error Visibility
- No logging of API responses
- Silent failures - errors were swallowed
- No user feedback on failures

## Solutions Implemented

### Backend Fixes (8 files)

#### 1. **lib/supabase.js**
- ✅ Exposed `supabaseAdmin` in db helper object
- Now accessible as `db.supabaseAdmin` in API routes

#### 2. **app/api/onboarding/progress/route.js**
- ✅ Added error checking after database insert
- ✅ Added `.select()` to verify data was saved
- ✅ Improved error responses with details
- ✅ Added success logging

#### 3. **app/api/onboarding/complete/route.js**
- ✅ Added error checking after database operations
- ✅ Added `.select()` to verify completion
- ✅ Return both profile and progress data
- ✅ Added success logging

#### 4. **app/api/user/save-consent/route.js**
- ✅ Changed from `createServerComponentClient` to `auth.getCurrentSession()`
- ✅ Use `db.supabaseAdmin` for database operations
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Added console logging for success/failure
- ✅ Return detailed error messages in development

### Frontend Fixes (4 files)

#### 5. **app/onboarding/personalize/page.js**
- ✅ Parse and log API error responses
- ✅ Log successful saves
- ✅ Show detailed error messages

#### 6. **app/onboarding/demo/page.js**
- ✅ Parse and log API error responses
- ✅ Log successful saves
- ✅ Show detailed error messages

#### 7. **app/onboarding/complete/page.js**
- ✅ Check response status
- ✅ Log errors and successes
- ✅ Handle failures gracefully

#### 8. **app/payment/page.js**
- ✅ Parse error responses from consent API
- ✅ Log success and failure
- ✅ Show user-friendly error messages
- ✅ Prevent redirect on save failure

## How to Test

### Step 1: Verify Migrations
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
-- File: supabase/migrations/add_onboarding_tables.sql
-- File: supabase/migrations/add_consent_tracking.sql
```

### Step 2: Start Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Server is now running on: **http://localhost:3001**

### Step 3: Test Onboarding
1. Go to `http://localhost:3001/onboarding`
2. Open browser Console (F12)
3. Complete the flow:
   - Select pain point → Check console for "Progress saved successfully"
   - View demos → Check console for "Demo progress saved successfully"
   - Complete → Check console for "Onboarding completed successfully"

### Step 4: Test Consent
1. Go to `http://localhost:3001/payment`
2. Open browser Console (F12)
3. Check all checkboxes
4. Click "Start Free Trial"
5. Check console for "Consent saved successfully"

### Step 5: Verify in Database
```sql
-- Check onboarding data
SELECT * FROM onboarding_progress
WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com')
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check consent data
SELECT
  email,
  terms_consent_accepted,
  terms_consent_timestamp,
  privacy_consent_accepted,
  privacy_consent_timestamp,
  refund_policy_consent_accepted,
  refund_policy_consent_timestamp,
  recurring_payment_consent_accepted,
  recurring_payment_consent_timestamp,
  trial_started_at,
  onboarding_completed,
  pain_point
FROM profiles
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

## What You Should See

### Browser Console (Success):
```
Progress saved successfully: {success: true, ...}
Consent saved successfully: {success: true, ...}
```

### Browser Console (Error):
```
Onboarding progress API error: {error: "...", details: "Column not found"}
Consent API error: {error: "...", details: "..."}
```

### Database (Success):
- `onboarding_progress` table has 3 rows for your user
- `profiles` table shows:
  - `onboarding_completed = true`
  - `pain_point = 'your-selected-pain-point'`
  - All consent fields = true
  - All consent timestamps populated
  - `trial_started_at` has timestamp

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Unauthorized" Error
**Fix:** Make sure you're logged in (`/auth/login`)

### Issue: "Column does not exist"
**Fix:** Run the migration files in Supabase SQL Editor

### Issue: "SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY not found"
**Fix:** Add to `.env.local`:
```
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```
Then restart server.

### Issue: Data saves but doesn't show in queries
**Fix:** Check Row Level Security - make sure you're querying as the right user or use service role.
