# Authentication Fix - URGENT

## The Problem
All API routes were returning **401 Unauthorized** errors because they were using client-side authentication on the server.

## The Fix Applied
Changed all API routes from using `auth.getCurrentSession()` (client-side only) to `createServerComponentClient({ cookies })` (server-side compatible).

### Files Fixed:
1. ✅ `app/api/onboarding/progress/route.js`
2. ✅ `app/api/onboarding/complete/route.js`
3. ✅ `app/api/user/save-consent/route.js`

## Port Situation
You have **3 servers running** on different ports because they didn't properly shut down:
- Port 3000: Old server (PID 75048)
- Port 3001: Middle server
- Port 3002: New server with fixes ✅ **USE THIS ONE**

## What To Do Now

### 1. Use Port 3002 (the fixed server)
```
http://localhost:3002/onboarding
http://localhost:3002/payment
```

### 2. Stop the old servers
Open a new terminal and run:
```bash
# Option A: Restart your computer (easiest)
# This will kill all Node processes

# Option B: Use Task Manager
# 1. Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc)
# 2. Find all "Node.js" processes
# 3. End each one
# 4. Then run: npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Again
1. Go to `http://localhost:3002/onboarding`
2. Open Console (F12)
3. Complete the onboarding flow
4. You should now see: ✅ "Progress saved successfully"
5. No more 401 errors!

### 4. Check If It Worked
Look in console - you should see:
```
✅ Progress saved successfully: {success: true, ...}
✅ Consent saved successfully: {success: true, ...}
```

NOT:
```
❌ 401 Unauthorized
```

## Why This Happened
The `auth.getCurrentSession()` function in `lib/auth.js` creates a client-side Supabase client, which doesn't work in server-side API routes. Server routes need access to cookies to read the auth token, which requires `createServerComponentClient({ cookies })`.

## Verification Query
After testing, check database:
```sql
SELECT * FROM onboarding_progress
WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE email = 'your-email');
```

You should now see data!

**IMPORTANT**: Always use **http://localhost:3002** until you restart your servers properly.
